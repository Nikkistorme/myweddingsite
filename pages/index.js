        <p>To our dear friends & family,</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, we would have you all together, sweating collectively under a relentless Austin sun while we exchange vows forever declaring to have a flawless, fight-free marriage for the rest of our lives.</p>
        <p>However, considering the current state of the globe, we've decided to forgo a traditional wedding in an effort to keep everyone sage from Covid-19 (and to not have to delay getting married for an undetermined future date that is virus-free).</p>
        <p>This means, we're tying the knot soon! In person, our wedding will be extremely small, but we'd be honored to have your virtual attendance!</p>
        <p>We haven't given up hope to have an in-person celebration some time in the future-we just don't jknow when that will feasible. Until then, we're so excited to share our special day any way we can with the most important people in our lives.</p>
        <p>All our love,</p>
        <p>N & A</p>
